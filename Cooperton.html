                <h3>Seven Fun Facts About Cooperton</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Meers Fault, an inactive but prominent geological structure, runs near the town’s vicinity. It dates back to the Permian‑Cambrian era and is considered a potential earthquake hazard, though dormant nowadays.</li>
                    <li>Early Cooperton had 18 businesses and a town board, but it failed to acquire a railroad, which contributed to its decline.</li>
                    <li>In 1961, the skeleton of a Columbian mammoth was discovered near the town. What made the find so controversial was its age: radiocarbon dating put the bones at 17,000 to 21,000 years old, much older than the generally accepted dates for human-mammoth kill sites in North America.</li>
                    <li>There are no jobs in Cooperton, so residents must travel to work. </li>
                    <li>It was originally called Cooper. </li>
                    <li>The Baptist Church is one of the most important buildings in town.</li>
                    <li>The <a href="https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry?entry=CU012" target="_blank">Cutthroat Gap massacre</a> took place in what is now Kiowa County, Oklahoma, near the town of Cooperton. </li>

                    Planned in 1899 by Frank Cooper, who had organized a settlement company in anticipation of the opening of the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache Reservation in August 1901. When he learned that the reservation would be opened with a lottery instead of a run, Cooper asked for and received 320 acres for his company members. He planned the settlement to be at the foot of the Wichita Mountains, about two miles east of the town's present location. However, an error was made when the townsite was registered. Later the name had to be changed to Cooperton, as there was already a Cooper in present Blaine County, Oklahoma.<br><br>
                    Cooperton grew and soon had eighteen businesses and a town board and expected a railroad. The first general store and post office were in a small building. Other businesses included a second general store, livery stable, drug store, bank, hardware store, and cotton gin. Also coming to town were a cigar factory, mill, blacksmith shop, and two hotels. Churches and a school were built, and a newspaper, the Cooperton Banner, was published.<br><br>
                    By 1910 Cooperton had one hundred residents. Despite its failure to acquire a railroad, the town grew gradually until 1940, when the population reached 187. Over the years the schools disbanded, students transferred, and people moved on. The 1960 population was 106, and the 1980 number was 31. By 2000 there were only 20 residents remaining. <br><br>
