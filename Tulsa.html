                    Oklahoma's second-largest city, Tulsa is located in the state's northeastern quadrant, adjacent to the Arkansas River. Tulsa's origins begin in the late 1820s with the removal of the Creek from their ancestral homes in Georgia and Alabama. After arriving here in 1833 the Lower Creek settled in present Tulsa, negotiating a treaty with the Cherokee and positioning the boundaries between the two nations. The border, as it was laid out, ran along the twenty-first century's Edison Street. The Creek held council meetings at the Council Oak tree, which is located on Eighteenth Street between Cheyenne and Boulder avenues. There the Creek band known as the Lochapoka deposited ashes brought from their last fires in Alabama. Soon many Creek turned to cattle raising, and by 1879 George Perryman established a ranch that covered most of present southern Tulsa. The ranch house, located near present Thirty-eighth and Trenton streets, later served as Tulsa's first post office, with Josiah Chouteau Perryman the first appointed postmaster.<br><br>
